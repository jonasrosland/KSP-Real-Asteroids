{
	name = CrashandScienceAsteroid
	title = Collect Data While Crashing into an Asteroid
	description = Your goal is to collect science from an asteroid while crashing into it. Our scientists back home will use the crash to measure dust patterns to see if the asteroid contains valuable materials (and perhaps Kethane!).
	synopsis = We want you to collect science from an asteroid before crashing into it using an unmanned probe.
	completedMessage = Congratulations. Thanks to the science you collected before the crash, and the data our scientists at home were able to collect, we now know that asteroids are made out of 90% awesome.
