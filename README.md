# KSP-Real-Asteroids

Created during the 2015 SpaceAppsChallenge in Boston: https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/explore-capture-and-redirect-real-asteroids-in-kerbal-space-program/

Our presentation for the event is available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OTNT7ZLz8V07lehsxV4-J6aZdaToWilgjvU1asy5vpM/edit?usp=sharing

## What is this?

This game mod will add REAL asteroid data into the game Kerbal Space Program and create missions so we can explore them, capture them and perhaps even sling them out into a different orbit.

## Why do this?

Learning about asteroids, how big they are, what they look like and what can be done with them in an interactive way where you control the outcome is an excellent way of teaching kids, teens and adults about all the asteroids that are out there. With this project we hope to show how asteroids are spread out throughout our solar system, how to get to them and also how to maybe save Earth one day if needed.

## How?

By using the graphics and game engine in the fun and creative game Kerbal Space Program we will build a mod that will load REAL asteroids into the game, with the correct orbits and sizes, and then have missions to explore them, capture them and sometimes sling them out into a different orbit.
